# Incorrect Object Comparison in React useEffect Hook

This repository demonstrates a common error in React applications involving the `useEffect` hook and object comparisons.  The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect implementation where objects are compared using strict equality, leading to potential bugs. The `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation.

## Problem

The problem lies in the comparison of objects within the `useEffect` hook's dependency array.  JavaScript's strict equality (`!==`) compares object references, not their contents. Thus, even if the object's properties have changed, the comparison may return `false`, resulting in the effect not running when it should. This often leads to unexpected behavior or, in worse cases, infinite loops.

## Solution

The solution is to use a deep comparison function to accurately detect changes in the object's contents.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides an example using a custom deep comparison function, which recursively checks for changes in nested objects and arrays.  Alternatively, libraries like Lodash's `isEqual` can simplify this process.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the directory
3. Run a React development server. (e.g. `npm start`)

This example highlights the importance of proper object comparison in React's `useEffect` hook for reliable application behavior.
